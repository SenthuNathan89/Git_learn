Here is the short story of my 150-kilometer trek from Portugal to Santiago de Compostela, Spain. Over 200,000 people hike each year on this pilgrimage. In the olden days when people were still stoned, this used to be a Christian pilgrimage to visit the grisly bones of Saint James. Nowadays many people make the hike and it\'92s no longer purely religious, although many people are still stoned.\cb1 \
\cb3 Either way, it\'92s certainly a spiritual journey.\cb1 \
\cb3 In terms of religious hikes, it doesn\'92t really compare in numbers to that of Mecca, where 15 million people walk each year. That walk mostly originates from Jeddah and clocks in at around 70 km. Either way, this epic Santiago hike I did has multiple routes. The full route is over 1200 km from France or a lighter version from Portugal at around 200 km. Mine was just 150 because we started right at the border in Tui, Spain. It\'92s also shorter because we are all kinda lazy and get the point after 150km.\cb1 \
\cb3 I\'92ve decided to tell a multi-part story via conversations I had with my nine other walkers. This event was put together by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://kk.org/biography"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Kevin Kelly}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://craigmod.com/about/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Craig Mod}} who have completed a few of these sorts of walks around the world. The idea is a bit of a \'93Walk n\'92 Talk\'94 where we mostly philosophize about the world, make jokes, and engage in a stimulating amount of mutual mental masturbation. Everyone on this adventure was from different walks of life. We had everything from tech magnates to authors to photographers to entrepreneurs to DNA researchers, and well, you name it.\cb1 \
\cb3 It was great, for me personally, to establish deep connections with each and every member of our hiking tribe. At least, I think I did!}
